The sparrow outside the window, on the wire pole with a big mouth
You said this sentence really, has the feeling of summer
The pencil in my hand, moves back and forth on the paper
I use a few lines of words to describe who you are to me

The taste of mackerel pike, you and the cat both want to understand
The fragrance of first love is retrieved by us just like this
That warm sunshine, is just like a freshly picked bright strawberry
You say you can't bear to eat this kind of feeling

The rain falls all night, my love overflows just like the rain
leaves fall in the courtyard, with my thoughts, it forms one thick pile
A bit of gossip, there's no way it can cool off my passion
You appear in every page of my poem

The rain falls all night, my loves overflows just like rain
The butterfly on the window sill, is like the poems beautful chapters fluttering about
I then write, I write that I'll always love you at the end of the poem
You're the only understanding that I want

The rain falls all night, my love overflows just like the rain
Leaves fall in the courtyard, with my thoughts, it forms one thick pile
A bit of gossip, there's no way it can cool off my passion
You appear in every page of my poem

That plump rice plant, blesssed this season
And your cheek is like a completely ripe tomato in the field
You suddenty tell me the name "common jasmine orange" is very beautiful
But at this moment, I just want to kiss your stubborn lips

The rain falls all night, my love overflows just like the rain
Leaves fall in the courtyard, with my thoughts, it forms one thick pile
A bit of gossip, there's no way it can cool off my passion
You appear in every page of my poem

The rain falls all night, my loves overflows just like rain
The butterfly on the window sill, is like the poems beautiful chapters fluttering about
I then write, I write that I'll always love you at the end of the poem
You're the only understanding that I want
