I travelled to the North, don't ask about my homewtown 
Not even the towering old wall, could block the sadness
I travelled to the North, is my family doing well?
Carrying a bag full of gloom on my shoulders

Some say he is debt-ridden, and forced to flee
Some say they couldn't find any place or opportuniy to show their talents
Some have lost thir way in way and wandering aimlessly
Some are working hard to fill their stomach and support their families

He lives in a jobs apartment on the outskirts of Beijing
populated by foreigners who come from all over the place
He's busy preparing his resume with huge expectations
Back and forth on 930th avenue while waiting for that miracle

Don't wanna listen and think about it, I dare not to turn back toward regrets
I insist to travel with my dreams
Being forced to let go all my previous prides and status
Even if I failed I will never give up or retreat

Farewell to the South, My most beautiful homeland
Illusions of my hometown, together with the swaying coconut tree are formed in my dream
It's too fuzzy and unclear, to the point that I can't see what's ahead


I travelled to the North, don't ask about my homewtown 
Not even the towering old wall, could block the sadness
I travelled to the North, is my family doing well?
Carrying a bag full of gloom on my shoulders
This will be my last and final attempt, It seems impossible to return to my far hometown Oh

They don't like this place because of the bad air and messiness
They can't get used to this place because of the traffic and it's rush
People ogling and viewing cynically towards each other on the sidewalk
He gets himself drunk all the time in attempt to mix into this contaiminated society

Wobbling around with a bottle of ErGuoTou in his hand
Those who're frustrated collapsed at the backlane
Chewing beef tripe with boiled mutton meat while holding a bowl of hot soup
Trying hard to relieve this uncomfortable heart

Don't wanna listen and think about it, I dare not to turn back toward regrets
I insist to travel with my dreams,
Being forced to let go all my previous prides and status
Even if I failed, I will never give up or retreat

Farewell to the South, My most beautiful homeland
Illusions of my hometown, together with the swaying coconut tree are formed in my dream
It's too fuzzy and unclear, to the point that I can't see what's ahead


I travelled to the North, don't ask about my homewtown 
Not even the towering old wall, could block the sadness
I travelled to the North, is my family doing well?
Carrying a bag on my shoulders, full of melancholy

Like the dust, I'm drifting together with the wind. Who could bring me to fly high in sky
I stood in the Temple of Heaven and closed my eyes, praying for the bliss of my family

I travelled to the North, don't ask about my homewtown 
Not even the towering old wall, could block the sadness
I travelled to the North, is my family doing well?
Carrying a bag full of gloom on my shoulders

Standing here in Beijing, I was stomped with the pressure and almost breathless
Walking on Qianmen Street, I still felt lost and not aligned with the public here
Maybe I don't belong here and have to leave
Enough with all this suffering, please kill me heartlessly

It's the center of all dreams, yet it is still out of reach
It's the holy land to reach your dream yet it's so bewildering 
Many were killed in the cruelty of reality here and disappeared
So many of them were fooled into the traps here yet in the end all that remains are lifeless corpses


It seems impossible to return to my far hometown Oh
I travelled to the North, don't ask about my homewtown
