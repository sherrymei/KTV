The wind that breezed through the two of us, where did it carry the sadness from?
The sky after I cried seemed to be more transparent

Father's words that always seemed to be sharp felt a bit warm today
I didn't know kindness, smiles and how to talk of my dreams, so I mimicked you on everything

Just a little longer is fine, a little more is fine, just a little longer is fine, so
Just a little longer is fine, a little more is fine; let's stick together, just a little longer

We are time-flyers, climbers that run up the time
Hiding and getting lost in the times, I don't want that anymore

We are time-flyers, climbers that run up the time
Hiding and getting lost in the times, I don't want that anymore

The toy that I got by praying to the stars is now lying in the corner of the room
As of today, I have 100 dreams I want true; let's exchange all of them with just one someday

I called out "See you tomorrow" after school today to that girl I don't usually talk to
It's good to do something unfamiliar sometimes, especially if you're beside me

Just a little longer is fine, a little more is fine, just a little longer is fine, so
Just a little longer is fine, a little more is fine; let's stick together, just a little longer

We are time-flyers; I knew you
Long before I learned my own name

There's probably some meaning even in a world you don't exist in
But a world you don't exist in is like an August without a summer vacation
A world you don't exist in is like a Santa Claus who doesn't laugh
A world you don't exist in is like...

We are time-flyers, climbers that run up the time
Hiding and getting lost in the times, I don't want that anymore

It's nothing, it's nothing after all
I'm coming now

We are time-flyers, climbers that run up the time
Hiding and getting lost in the times, enough of that now

We are time-flyers, climbers that run up the time
Hiding and getting lost in the times, enough of that now

Crying because I'm happy, laughing because I'm sad;
It's because my heart surpassed myself.
