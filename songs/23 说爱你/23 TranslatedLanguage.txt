My world becomes wonderful and more unspeakable
I thought it's a dreamland from the heaven
Until I make sure that the temperature of my hand is from your heart
At this moment,  finally I'm brave enough to say I love you 

At the beginning, I only look at you 
Pretend to be casual but my hear just drifts over to you
I just chuckle to myself that you didn't find me hidden in the corner
I'm so happy and touched
We become familiar with each other from strangers
True love is what I can't expect until now

I want to prove that I have really been reminded of by you  
I think at random from today I wish
It looks like a trap but I never hesitate to believe that
If you are really willing to, please give me a surprise

As to love, I didn't imagine unrealistic ending before
But from that day, I overturned my logic
All the answers of my doubts become clear because of you
I walk around and around and then really meet Mr. Right
