If one day,
I can back to the past
Back to the original me,
will you
think that I'm not bad?

If one day,
I'm far away from you
Can't date with you,
do you realize that 
I already said goodbye?

When your eyes squinted with smiling,
when you drank a cola, when you're noisy
I want to be good for you,
but you don't understand,
miss you, miss you,
it will become a hobby

When you told your today's problems,
when you said in the midnight that you can't sleep
I wanted to say to you,
but I'm afraid that I'll say it all wrong,
I really like you,
do you understand?

If one day,
the dreams become reality
Memories all become foreverness,
do you will still remember today?

If one day,
we'll realize
As it turns out,
anything will possible,
will we stay here?

When your eyes squinted with smiling,
when you drank a cola, when you're noisy
I want to be good for you,
but you don't understand,
miss you, miss you,
it will become a hobby

When you told your today's problems,
when you said in the midnight that you can't sleep
I wanted to say to you,
but I'm afraid that I'll say it all wrong,
I really like you,
do you understand?

Maybe emptiness make me think too much,
maybe I should back to the bed
In the dreams I will meet you,
( I'll not ) hesitate,
(to) say loudly what I want to say

When your eyes squinted with smiling,
when you drank a cola, when you're noisy
I want to be good for you,
but you don't understand,
miss you, miss you,
it will become a hobby

When you told your today's problems,
when you said in the midnight that you can't sleep
I wanted to say to you,
but I'm afraid that I'll say it all wrong,
I really like you,
do you understand?

When your eyes squinted with smiling,
when you drank a cola, when you're noisy
I want to be good for you,
but you don't understand,
miss you, miss you,
it will become a hobby

la~ la~

I wanted to say to you,
but I'm afraid that I'll say it all wrong,
I really like you,
do you understand?
