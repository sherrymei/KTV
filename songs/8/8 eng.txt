If one day 
I returned to the past
I became the original me 
would you 
think that I was cool.

If one day 
I left you
And could not meet you again
would you realise
that I have already said goodbye.

When you laughed with your eyes closed
when you had your coke, when you rattled
I wanna treat you well
but you never know 
that missing you 
could become an obsession.

When you told me your troubles today
when you say you couldn't fall asleep at night
I wanna tell you
but I was afraid that I would say this wrong
I liked you a lot
did you know that?

If one day 
all dreams came true,
All memories became immortal
would you still remember today.

If one day 
we both realized
everything was fine
would we
still stay at this moment

When you laughed with your eyes closed
when you had your coke, when you rattled
I wanna treat you well
but you never know 
that missing you 
could become an obsession.

When you told me your troubles today
when you say you couldn't fall asleep at night
I wanna tell you
but I was afraid that I would say this wrong
I liked you a lot
did you know that?

Maybe loneliness drove me paranoid
maybe I should go back to sleep.
I will meet you in the dream
say what I need to say
loud and determined.

When you laughed with your eyes closed
when you had your coke, when you rattled
I wanna treat you well
but you never know 
that missing you 
could become an obsession.

When you told me your troubles today
when you say you couldn't fall asleep at night
I wanna tell you
but I was afraid that I would say this wrong
I liked you a lot
did you know that?

When you laughed with your eyes closed
when you drank your coke when you rattled
I wanna treat you well
but you never know 
that missing you 
could become an obsession.

lalalala lalalala

I want to tell you
but I was afraid that I would say this wrong
I liked you a lot
did you know that?
