There is nothing that can stop
You to persuade freedom
In this unconstrained life
your heart is not attached 

Life has been gloomy
and I have been confused
The moment when you look down 
Then realized the road under your feet

The free world in my heart
Is so pure but far away
Blooming the flower that never wilt
The Blue Lotus

Life has been gloomy
and I have been confused
The moment when you look down 
Then realized the road under your feet

Life has been gloomy
and I have been confused
The moment when you look down 
Then realized the road under your feet

The free world in my heart
Is so pure but far away
Blooming the flower that never wilt
The Blue Lotus
