Woo~
I love you so
Just come with me

I do not know how many times I have gone the wrong way
I finally realize, to love someone, needs more than perspiration
Naively thought, by holding you, I could retain happiness
The reality proved me wrong, but I am not afraid to give (?)

So I Say Come Out Your Way, Come Out Your Way With Me
I will protect you, with my self, the storm of loneliness
So Baby Come Out Your Way, Come Out Your Way With Me
I Love U So, I Love U So 
Right next to your ear I say, love me

I want to find a way, that leads straignt to happiness
While the end is right before us, we went all the way around it
Advices from friends, I get them all, but the future still unclear
I am scared, that you suddenly, forget how to get back to my side

So I Say Come Out Your Way, Come Out Your Way With Me
I will protect you, with my self, the storm of loneliness
So Baby Come Out Your Way, Come Out Your Way With Me
I Love U So, I Love U So 
Right next to your ear I say, love me

Even I was proved wrong by the reality, I am not afraid to give (?)

So I Say Come Out Your Way, Come Out Your Way With Me
I can't forget, I can't give up. I need to be with you
So Baby Come Out Your Way, Come Out Your Way With Me
I Love U So, I Love U So 
Once more, I want to hear you say, you love me
