Every nightfall
Loneliness surrounds me
Every dusk my heartbeat
Reminds me of your warmth
Every time I face you
I can't look into your eyes
Under my loving smiles
Hide tears of sorrow

However time and space change
Whatever happens in this world
Your love lives on in my heart
Do you understand?
I want to transcend the ordinary life
Destined to wander the earth
I must follow the ambitions of my heart
My pursuit of the future

Embracing you
Oh my baby
I see you are crying
Is it because you love me
That you are heartbroken?

Embracing you
Oh my baby
You know I must go
Even if it makes me pale and haggard
And covered in wounds

However time and space change
Whatever happens in this world
Your love lives on in my heart
Do you understand?
I want to transcend the ordinary life
Destined to wander the earth
I must follow the ambitions of my heart
My pursuit of the future

Embracing you
Oh my baby
I see you are crying
Is it because you love me
That you are heartbroken?

Embracing you
Oh my baby
You know I must go
Even if it makes me pale and haggard
And covered in wounds

Embracing you
Oh my baby
I see you are crying
Is it because you love me
That you are heartbroken?

Embracing you
Oh my baby
You know I must go
Even if it makes me pale and haggard
And covered in wounds

Oh baby
Don't cry
Oh baby
Oh baby
Don't cry
Baby
Baby
