I say a goodbye to your memory.

The shy person who sits next to me
Would blush every time I said "Thank you".
Together, we decided on a secret phrase.
Even if we were far apart, I'm sure I'd recognize it immediately.

If we can meet again some new day,
I'll hope this simple letter can reach you.
Ahh, but you don't even bother to read it.
Why'd you just leave it sitting there?

I say a goodbye to your memory.
Your long hair hides your cheeks from view,
So I'm having trouble reading you.
Even though I use to know you better than anyone else...
You're no longer there sitting next to me.

Sparsely connected, far-off memories
Were missing just a part here and there. Something was missing...
We shouldn't have ever forgotten
The words we said back then,
But we still did...

Pierced by your mature gaze,
My panicking heart feels about to float away.
Ahh, I hate how I'm like this,
So childlike in every way.

Your face leaves an impression as I watch you from the side,
Watching you smile in a way I've never seen before.
You seem like someone from a parallel world.
In the time I spend spaced out,
You keep walking even further beyond.

I hear my footsteps chasing you from behind.
I stop in place for a moment.
Your lips form the slightest shape
And in the blink of an eye, I crossed a bridge to connect our time.

You're no longer there sitting next to me.
You're an adult now, all alone.

I say a goodbye to your memory.
Your long hair looks so good on you.
It's a bit embarrassing for me,
But I want to know you better than anyone else...
So can I sit next to you?
