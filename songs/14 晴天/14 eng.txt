The little yellow flower in the story, keeps floating since I was born
The swing in childhood has swung with my memory until now 

Re So So Si Do Si La
So La Si Si Si Si La Si La So

Play the prelude, gaze at the sky
I recall that pedals tried to fall 

The day I skipped class for you 
The day flowers fell
The classroom, why I can't see them 
The disappered rainy days, I really want to relive it again
I didn't know that I still kept the courage I lost
I really want to ask again if you will wait or walk away  

On the windy day, I tried to hold your hands
But unexpectedly, the rain
Became so heavy that I can't see you
How long I will be wtih you again
Until the sunny day,
Maybe I could feel a little better then

Long long ago, someone had loved you so long
But unexpectedly, the wind gradually
make the distance so far
Luckily, I could love you for one more day
But at the end of the story
It seemed that you still said byebye
