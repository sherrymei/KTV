All love begins, with a beautiful opening
Like those classics - Titanic, Romeo and Juliet
Their scenes of passion and romance
tell us of a love that surpasses death and parting
There was once, we both vowed, we'd never change

Don't say see you, those words
will end everything
Please don't say see you, your words
were spoken so bluntly
Since when has there been two different worlds between us
that don't even overlap each other
If we part, will we ever meet again? 

Imprinted in photos, our memories of love forever
But no matter how sweet, it's only a frame frozen in time
The romantic, down tune melodies
already spoke of love and parting
We should've believed those predictions; afterall we aren't that exceptional. 

Don't say see you, those words
makes love seem superficial
Please don't say see you, your words
won't change anything
Since when has there been two different worlds between us
that don't even overlap each other
No need for sorry. It is really a goodbye. 

Although fate may have us meet again
The Earth will always remain round
and even if today you travel afar,
there will still be one horizon
Although wishes don't always come true
and promises aren't always kept
awaken and tomorrow is a brand new day

Don't say see you, those words
makes love seem superficial
Please don't say see you, your words
won't change anything
Since when has there been two different worlds between us
that don't even overlap each other
No need for sorry. It is really a goodbye. 

When love meets it's end, all we can say is goodbye.
