(Fang)
I was joking, don't be serious I was just unintentionally humorous
Why be like this, turned around and ignored me
Alright babe, it was me who did some said some messed up something 
Calm down and don't flame me yet
Don't rage, I can say sorry a hundred times
Don't sigh, a quarry is not something terrific

(Xu)
You guys' nonchalance is just getting over yourselves
Us gals again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses just to sillily fancy yourself
You never learn, whether it is a mix-up, a redemption, or a mistake of yours

(Fang)
Is it my fault, or the time of the month that is killing me
Why be like this, I can't bear the silence
Alright babe, I will take the blame and it was my fault. Come on!
Let's hug and don't slip away
Don't rage, I can say sorry a hundred times
Don't sigh, a quarry is not something terrific

(Xu)
You guys' nonchalance is just getting over yourselves
Us gals again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses  just to sillily fancy yourself
You never learn, whether it is a mix-up, a redemption, or a mistake of yours

(Chorus)
Is it that you don't love me enough? Is it that you don't know me well?
Is it that my words just exited your ears?

(Xu)
You guys' nonchalance is just getting over yourselves
Us gals again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses  just to sillily fancy yourselves
They never learn, just admit that it is your fault

(Xu)
You guys' nonchalance is just getting over yourselves
Us gals again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses just to fancy yourself
You never learn, whether it is a mix-up, a redemption, or a mistake of yours
