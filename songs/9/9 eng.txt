(Fang)
I was joking, don't be serious, I was just unintentionally humorous
Why be like this, turning around and ignoring me
Alright babe, it was me who did something messed up something 
Calm down and don't be angry
Don't rage, I say sorry a hundred times
Don't sigh, a quarrel is not that big of a deal

(Xu)
I say men's indifferent attitudes are always selfish
Us girls again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses just to be silly and fancy yourself
You never learn, whether it is a mix-up, a redemption, or a mistake of yours

(Fang)
Is it my fault, or the time of the month that is killing me
Why be like this, I can't bear the silence
Alright babe, I will take the blame and it was my fault. Come on!
Let's hug and don't slip away
Don't rage, I can say sorry a hundred times
Don't sigh, a quarrel is not that big of a deal

(Xu)
I say men's indifferent attitudes are always selfish
Us girls again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses just to be silly and fancy yourself
You never learn, whether it is a mix-up, a redemption, or a mistake of yours

(Chorus)
Is it that you don't love me enough? Is it that you don't know me well?
Is it that my words just never entered your ears?

(Xu)
I say men's indifferent attitudes are always selfish
Us girls again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses just to be silly and fancy yourself
They never learn, just admit that it is your fault

(Xu)
I say men's indifferent attitudes are always selfish
Us girls again and again are giving you chances
Please don't get a bunch of excuses just to fancy yourself
You never learn, whether it is a mix-up, a redemption, or a mistake of yours
