The east of the northeastern part of Dunhuang as the center
The Nation's coastline is like a bow
The Great Wall is like a dream waiting to be shot after more than five thousand years
I split the heavy earth with arms
What contents left by the wind towards south from Mongolia plateau
Whether or not understand Chinese characters, we are with the same color of skin and faces
Across the east of the Yellow River, climb the peak of Mount Tai
I go towards the West, lead the north wind and get tan into bronze

Longing for being linked by blood
Infinite brothers
I open the sky and land, empty the Yangtze River
In the process of transformation in the ancient riverbed

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
Remove the mountains and rivers and fill the cracks
Adjust the time and space of sunrise in the Oriental
Go back to the foreworld to dispose and manipulate

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
The heart of the land is beating uneasily
There is only one facial expression left in the world
Wait for the hero, I am the dragon

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
Remove the mountains and rivers and fill the cracks
Adjust the time and space of sunrise in the Oriental
Go back to the foreworld to dispose and manipulate

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
The heart of the land is beating uneasily
There is only one facial expression left in the world
Wait for the hero, I am the dragon

Longing for being linked by blood
Infinite brothers
I open the sky and land, empty the Yangtze River
In the process of transformation in the ancient riverbed

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
Remove the mountains and rivers and fill the cracks
Adjust the time and space of sunrise in the Oriental
Go back to the foreworld to dispose and manipulate

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
The heart of the land is beating uneasily
There is only one facial expression left in the world
Wait for the hero, I am the dragon

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
Remove the mountains and rivers and fill the cracks
Adjust the time and space of sunrise in the Oriental
Go back to the foreworld to dispose and manipulate

I use right fist to open the sky and turn into a dragon
The heart of the land is beating uneasily
There is only one facial expression left in the world
Wait for the hero, (wait) I am the dragon

Turn into a dragon
Fill the cracks
Adjust the time and space
To dispose and to manipulate
Turn into a dragon
Beat uneasily
There is only one left
Wait for the hero
I am the dragon
