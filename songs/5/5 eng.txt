I would dream of venturing into the world,
Experiencing its hustle and bustle.
How frivolous was the heart of the youth!
Now you wander about the world.

Where’s the girl you loved so dearly?
Now she can’t be traced.
Love always brings yearning and worry, 
Hurting you from head to toe.

Walking forward bravely on the road,

I have sorrow and joy.

Every time when you’re sad and grieved,
Go alone to see the sea.
You will think of your friends walking along with you on the road.
How many are healing their hearts?

Unconscious of the forlorn nights they’ve experienced,

They wake up from yestreen drunkenness.

They wake up from yesterday's drunkenness.

Every time when you’re sad and grieved,
Go alone to see the sea.
You would think of your friends walking along with you on the road.
How many are waking?

Let’s finish the cup of wine,
And widen our vision and mind like the sea.
Having experienced the warmth and cold of life
You will feel the innocence of the warm smile.
