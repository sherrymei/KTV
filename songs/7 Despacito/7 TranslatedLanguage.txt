Ay, ¡Fonsi! ¡D.Y.!
Ohhh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Hey, yeah!
Dididiri Daddy, Go!


Yes, you know I’ve been looking at you for a while
I have to dance with you today
(D.Y.!) I saw that your gaze was already calling me
Show me the way, that I’ll go


Oh
you, you are the magnet and I am the metal
I’m getting closer and I’m putting together the plan
Just by thinking of it my pulse accelerates (Oh yeah)
I’m already like her more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This must be taken without any urgency


Little by little
I want to breathe in your neck slowly
Let me tell you things to your ear
So that you remember if you’re not with me
Little by little
I want to kiss you naked slowly
I sign on the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
(Up, Up, Up
Go up up)


I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm
For you to show my mouth
Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
Until I make you scream
And you forget your last name


If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me, I know what you’re thinking about it
I have been trying for some time, Mami, this is giving and giving it
You know your heart with me makes you bang-bang
You know that baby is looking for my bang-bang
Come, try from my mouth to see how it tastes
I want, I want, I want to see how much love fits you
I’m not in a hurry, I want to travel
Let’s start slow, then wild


Step by step, slow little by little
We’re coming near, little by little
When you kiss me with that ability
I see you are malice with delicacy
Step by step, slow little by little
We’re coming near, little by little
Because that beauty is a puzzle
But I have the piece to the mount
Hey!


Little by little
I want to breathe in your neck slowly
Let me tell you things to your ear
So that you remember if you’re not with me
Little by little
I want to kiss you naked slowly
I sign on the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
(Up, Up, Up
Go up up)


I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm
For you to show my mouth
Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
Until I make you scream
And you forget your last name


Little by little
Let’s do it on a beach in Puerto Rico
Until the waves shout “Oh, my God!”
So that my seal stays with you
Dance it!


Step by step, slow little by little
We’re coming near, little by little
For you to show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Step by step, slow little by little
We’re coming near, little by little
Until I make you scream (Fonsi)
And you forget your last name (D.Y.)
Little by little
