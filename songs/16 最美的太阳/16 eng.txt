My world is beautiful because of you
My sky is not dark because of you
You give me happiness, you feel sad for me and cry for me
You give me tolerance, which make me could open my wings and fly high

Your words, your tears, your smile and your beauty
Are more than the most beautiful rose in my eyes

Hold on to my dream, fly forward
Don't escape, don't move backward
You are the fortress on my road to success

You give me wings, which make me could fly
You give me power, which make me become strong
I'm not afraid of injuries because you are by my side
Your smile, your tears
Are the most beautiful sun on my road to realize dreams

Your words, your tears, your smile and your beauty
Are more than the most beautiful rose in my eyes
Hold on to my dream, fly forward
Don't escape, don't move backward
You are the fortress on my road to success

You give me wings, which make me could fly
You give me power, which make me become strong
I'm not afraid of injuries because you are by my side
Your smile, your tears
Are the most beautiful sun on my road to realize dreams

You give me wings, which make me could fly
You give me power, which make me become strong
I'm not afraid of injuries because you are by my side
Your smile, your tears
Are the most beautiful sun on my road to realize dreams
Are the most beautiful sun on my road to realize dreams
