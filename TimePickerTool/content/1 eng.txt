Wandering along the road,
are you leaving?
Fragile and proud,
I used to be just like that.
Fervent and agitated,
where are you headed?
Enigmatic and silent,
are you really listening to the story?

I climbed over mountains, voyaged across oceans,
waded through crowds of people.
I used to own everything,
but it was all gone in the blink of an eye.
I was frustrated, disappointed, lost all sense of direction,
until I discovered that ordinary was the only answer.

You were still dreaming 
about tomorrow,
will it get better, or worse?
For me, it's another day.
I destroyed everything I had, 
wanting to leave and never come back.
I fell into endless darkness,
struggling in vain.
I was like you and him, like wild flowers and grass，
desperate, longing, crying, laughing, being ordinary.

Walk forward, just like this,
even when something is given to you.
Walk forward, just like this,
even when something is taken from you.
Walk forward, just like this,
even if you will miss something.
Walk forward, just like this,
even when ...

I climbed over mountains, voyaged across oceans,
waded through crowds of people.
I used to own everything,
but it was all gone in the blink of an eye.
I was frustrated, disappointed, lost all sense of direction,
until I discovered that ordinary was the only answer.

I destroyed everything I had,
wanting to leave and never come back.
Once I fell into endless darkness,
struggling in vain.
I was like you and him, like wild flowers and grass,
desperate, longing, crying and laughing, being ordinary.

I climbed over mountains, voyaged across oceans,
waded through crowds of people.
I asked the whole world,
yet never found the answer.
I was just like you and him, like wild flowers and grass,
it is destined to be my only road.

Time silent, just like that,
tomorrow is soon coming.
Breeze gentle, road long,
which chapter of your story are you at?﻿
