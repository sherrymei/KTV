1) currently on github:
(master)
to just run the server
node server.js
check mongoURL:
	var mongoURL = "mongodb://localhost:27017/songs"
	var mongoURL = "mongodb://readonly:readonly@ds127872.mlab.com:27872/heroku_0kfm3lp6"
if local:
	./start_mongod

should be good to go.

	a) if you want to do react development (aka mess with the code in webpage/)
		run: 'npm run webpack'
		it will detect any file changes in webpage/* and generate a dist/bundle.js file, which is what index.html uses

2) to checkout Tyler's new pull request:
save or stash your local changes
git checkout -b Nickersoft-css master
git pull https://github.com/Nickersoft/KTV.git css

to run , 
install docker
then in $KTV, run 'docker-container up'
then visit localhost:8080. no need to mongod anymore

3) to go back to master
git checkout master


4) to push / deploy to heroku
make sure you are logged in
heroku login
git add .
git commit -m "blah"
git push heroku master
